#  Andorra government approves sports betting

The Andorran government has given the green light to a new bill that would regulate and tax sports betting within the country. The new law is expected to come into effect in early 2019, and will allow operators to apply for licences to offer sports betting services.

Under the new law, operators will be required to pay a licence fee of €50,000, as well as a tax of 15% on gross gaming revenue. In addition, operators will be required to contribute 2% of their gross gaming revenue to social causes.

Andorra’s Minister for Finance, Jaume Bartomeu, commented on the approval of the bill, stating: “This law seeks to regulate a market that already exists and which is growing, while at the same time ensuring that Andorra benefits from its taxation.”

Betting on sports is popular in Andorra, with around 60% of the population betting on at least one sport each year. The new law is expected to bring in an additional €1 million in tax revenue each year.

#  Andorran government opens up sports betting market

The Andorran government announces the opening of its sports betting market to private operators. The government has been working on this project for some time, and the goal is to improve the regulation of the betting market and increase its tax income.

The Minister of Finance, Jordi Cinca, says that private operators will be able to offer their services once a public tender is launched in the coming weeks. He added that this move will bring more transparency and competitiveness to the market.

The Minister of Sport, Gerard Revert, said that the new regulation would provide more guarantees for bettors. He also emphasised that the government wanted to promote responsible gambling habits.

This announcement comes at a time when other European countries are also liberalising their sports betting markets. In neighbouring Spain, for example, online gambling operator Codere has recently secured a licence from the Spanish regulator to offer sports betting services in the country.

#  Government of Andorra permits sports betting

On September 12, the government of Andorra announced that it will allow regulated sports betting in the principality. The government also said that it plans to work with the private sector to develop a safe and responsible sports betting market.

This is a major development for the gambling industry in Europe. Andorra is a small principality located between France and Spain. It is not well known for its gambling industry, but this announcement could change that.

Andorra joins a growing list of European countries that have legalized some form of sports betting. In recent years, several other countries in Europe have liberalized their gambling laws. These include Portugal, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

This trend is likely due to increased pressure from the European Union (EU). The EU has been pushing for more liberal gambling laws across Europe, as part of its efforts to create a single market for digital goods and services.

The legalization of sports betting in Andorra is good news for operators in the region. Andorra has been one of the last European countries to open up its gambling market to private operators. This means that there is considerable potential for growth in the coming years.

At present, there are only a few licensed operators in Andorra. But with the new regulations in place, more operators are likely to enter the market in the coming months and years.

#  New gambling regulations in Andorra allow for sports betting

On July 20, 2017, the Andorran government published new regulations for gambling in the principality. The regulations allow for sports betting and come into effect on September 1, 2017.

The new regulations are a response to the growing popularity of online gambling, especially sports betting. Andorra wants to ensure that its gambling industry is properly regulated and that tax revenues from gambling are appropriately shared among the government and the industry's operators.

Under the new regulations, operators who want to offer sports betting in Andorra must first obtain a license from the government. Licenses will be granted only to operators who can demonstrate their financial stability and their ability to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Taxes will be imposed on both operators and players. The tax rate on operators will be 5%, while the tax rate on players will be 15%. These rates are significantly lower than those in most other European countries.

Andorra has been an attractive destination for online gambling because of its low taxes and liberal regulatory regime. It is hoped that the new regulations will help to protect consumers and ensure that the gambling industry operates in a responsible manner.

#  Andorran government lifts ban on sports betting

On Tuesday, the Andorran government announced that it was lifting its ban on sports betting. The decision follows a proposal from the government’s finance commission to allow gambling companies to operate in the principality.

Andorra had been one of the last holdouts on legalizing sports betting, which is now legal in most European countries. Under the new regulations, operators will be required to have a presence in the country and will be taxed at a rate of 15 percent.

The move is seen as a way for Andorra to increase its tax revenue. In a statement, Finance Minister Jordi Cinca said that the introduction of sports betting would bring in an additional €5 million per year in tax revenue.

Opposition politicians were quick to criticize the move, warning that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and crime rates. But Cinca defended the decision, saying that it would be tightly regulated and that there would be measures in place to protect consumers.

Sports betting has become increasingly popular in Europe over the past few years. In 2017, total bets placed online in Europe reached €24.3 billion, up from €21.8 billion in 2016.
