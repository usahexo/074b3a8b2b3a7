#  What is the maximum bet limit for Sparkling 777s?

The maximum bet limit for Sparkling 777s is $10,000. This means that players are not able to wager more than this amount per spin.

#  Are there any other bonuses available in addition to the welcome bonus?

Most casinos offer a welcome bonus to new players, which is a percentage of the player's first deposit. However, there may be other bonuses available to players as they continue to play at the casino. These could include bonuses for loyalty, or for playing specific games. Check the casino's website or Terms and Conditions to see what else is available.

# What are the Wagering Requirements?

Wagering requirements are the amount of times a player must wager their bonus before they can withdraw any winnings. So, for example, if a casino has a wagering requirement of 30x the bonus amount, that means you must wager 30 times the amount of your bonus before you can withdraw any money. Make sure you read the Terms and Conditions carefully so you are aware of the wagering requirements before accepting a bonus.

# What is a Sticky Bonus?

A sticky bonus is a type of bonus that can't be cashed out until it has been wagered a certain number of times. So, for example, if you have a sticky bonus of $100 and the wagering requirement is 30x, you would need to wager $3,000 ($100 x 30) before being able to cash out any winnings.
