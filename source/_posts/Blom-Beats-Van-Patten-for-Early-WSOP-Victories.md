#  Blom Beats Van Patten for Early WSOP Victories

The first two days of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event were a triumph for Dutchman Joran Blom, who took down two bracelets and a heap of cash.

Taking on some of the biggest names in poker, Blom was uniformly impressive in his victories, defeating Chris Van Patten in the $10,000 Razz event and then Josh Arieh in the $5,000 Omaha Hi/Lo Split tournament.

Arieh had been one of the pre-tournament favourites, but Blom was not to be denied his moment in the sun. In yesterday's final he dealt with seasoned campaigners like Michael Mizrachi and Allen Kessler to take home his second bracelet of the series.

"I'm really happy," said Blom afterwards. "This is what I play poker for – to win events like this."

There is no doubt that these victories have put Blom firmly on the map as one of the top talents in world poker. He now has over $2 million in career earnings, and he will be looking to add to that total as the WSOP continues.

#  Gus Hansen Finally Ends Longest Losing Streak in Poker History

It was long overdue, but on Sunday night Gus Hansen finally ended his epic losing streak at the poker tables. The Danish poker pro’s win over Bill Perkins gave him his first victory in over two years and snapped a staggering 427-game losing streak.

Hansen is no stranger to bad beats and long losing streaks, but this one has to go down as one of the most brutal ever in the history of professional poker. In fact, if you exclude Hansen’s brief comeback in late 2016, his current losing streak would be 479 games long – by far the longest of any player in modern history.

Hansen’s last win came at the Super High Roller Bowl in May 2016 when he took down $3.5 million for first place. After that, things went from bad to worse as he quickly became one of the biggest losers in online poker.

To make matters worse, Hansen also started piling up some massive losses in live tournaments. He finished second in the €100,000 Super High Roller at PokerStars Championship Barcelona for $1.5 million, but that was his only notable cash since early 2016.

So after enduring nearly two years of frustrating defeats, it was understandably a huge relief for Hansen when he finally managed to take down Bill Perkins heads-up and pick up the $84,000 winner’s prize. In an interview with PokerListings shortly after his win, Hansen described it as “one of the best feelings I’ve ever had”.

The Dane also singled out his successful bluff against Perkins as one of the key hands of the match: “I had queens against A-10 and I made a four-bet shove on the flop. It was a pure bluff – I didn’t have anything – but it worked."

Looking ahead, Hansen is now eyeing another prestigious high roller event – this time the €25,000 buy-in European Poker Tour (EPT) Grand Final in Monte Carlo next month. It will be interesting to see if Hansen can carry over his newly found winning form and finally add an EPT title to his long list of poker achievements.

#  Phil Ivey and Daniel Negreanu Vie for WSOP Main Event Title

For the second year in a row, Phil Ivey and Daniel Negreanu are the last two players remaining in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event. Ivey, who is seeking his 10th WSOP bracelet, has a 5-2 chip advantage over Negreanu.

Ivey has been one of the most dominant players in poker history, but Negreanu is no slouch. The Canadian has six WSOP bracelets and is considered one of the best all-around players in the game.

The final table began on Sunday with eight players remaining. They were eventually whittled down to Ivey and Negreanu, who both have over $8 million in career earnings.

Here's a look at how they reached the final table:

Ivey began the final table as the chip leader, with around 115 million chips. He eliminated four opponents, including Max Pescatori in third place ($2,278,021).

Negreanu had a roller coaster ride at the final table. He started out as one of the shorter stacks with just 26 million chips. He was able to double up twice early on, but then lost most of his chips to Fabian Quoss. However, Negreanu battled back and managed to win some key hands to reach the heads-up match against Ivey.

It should be an exciting showdown between these two legends of poker. Whoever wins will take home $10 million and become the new World Champion!

#  Jay Farber Wins $10 Million, World Series of Poker Crown

Jay Farber, a young poker player who had only been playing professionally for about four years, won the world’s most prestigious poker tournament on November 10th, 2013. The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is an annual event that takes place in Las Vegas and has a $10,000 buy-in.

Farber outlasted 6,352 other players to take home the $10 million first prize and the coveted WSOP gold bracelet. In doing so, he became just the 18th person ever to win both a World Series of Poker bracelet and a World Poker Tour (WPT) title.

When asked how it felt to win such a prestigious event, Farber said simply, “unbelievable.” He added that he could not have done it without the support of his friends and family.

The final table of the 2013 WSOP consisted of some of the most accomplished poker players in the world, including Phil Ivey and Antonio Esfandiari. But in the end it was Farber who emerged victorious.

This was Farber’s first time playing in the main event of the WSOP, but he had already made a name for himself by winning two other major tournaments this year. In March he took down the $1 million buy-in Big One for One Drop tournament at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, and in July he won the WPT World Championship at Aria Resort & Casino.

At just 29 years old, Jay Farber is sure to be one of poker’s rising stars for many years to come. Congratulations to him on an amazing victory!
