#  How to Create Custom Bingo Cards in Excel 

Bingo is a classic game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It’s perfect for family game nights, parties, or when you just need some down time. And if you want to get creative with your bingo playing experience, you can create custom bingo cards in Excel.

There are a few things to keep in mind when creating custom bingo cards. The first is the size and shape of your card. Most bingo cards are 5x5 squares, but you can make them any size you like. You can also choose any shape for your card – round, heart-shaped, star-shaped, etc.

The second thing to consider is the layout of your card. You’ll need to decide how many columns and rows you want, and what kind of patterns you want your cards to have. If you’re creating a traditional 5x5 square card, each column will have 5 spaces and each row will have 10 spaces. But you can get creative with the layout if you like.

The third thing to think about is what information to include on your cards. The standard bingo card has the numbers 1-75 listed in five rows and five columns. But you can list any information you like on your cards – words, phrases, pictures, etc.

Now that you know the basics of creating custom bingo cards in Excel, let’s walk through an example. We’ll create a heart-shaped card with a Valentine’s Day theme. The card will have six columns and six rows, and we’ll list different phrases in each column and row.

To create a custom bingo card in Excel:
1) Open a new Excel document and select the “Heart” shape from the Shapes gallery (or use any shape that you prefer).
2) In the Size & Properties pane on the right side of the screen, adjust the size of the heart to match the size of your card (ours is 6x6).
3) In the Design tab (located in the Ribbon at the top of the screen), change the fill color of your heart to red or any other color that you like.
4) Next, we’ll add our column and row headings to the top of our card. To do this, type “Column A” in cell A1 and “Row 1” in cell B1 . Then select both cells and drag them down until they reach row 6 .
5) Next, we’ll type our phrases into each column and row. Type “Valentine’s Day Greetings” in cell A2 , “I Love You” in cell B2 , “Xoxo” in cell C2 , etc. until all 36 cells are filled .
6) Select all of your text cells (A1:B36) and drag them over so they line up with the heart shape. Your final product should look something like this:

      





	Now that we have our custom bingo card created, let’s play a game! Choose someone to start as caller, then take turns picking numbers from 1-75 until someone gets Bingo!

#  How to Quickly and Easily Make Bingo Cards in Excel 

Do you enjoy playing bingo? Perhaps you’re looking for a new way to make the game more exciting. If so, you may be interested in learning how to quickly and easily create bingo cards in Excel.

There are a few different ways to go about creating bingo cards in Excel. In this tutorial, we will show you two of the easiest methods.

Creating Bingo Cards with Tables

The first way to create bingo cards in Excel is by using tables. This method is ideal if you want to create multiple bingo cards at once.

To get started, open up a new worksheet in Excel and create a table like the one below:

Now, all you need to do is fill in the boxes with the numbers or words that you want on your bingo card. Once you have finished, select the entire table and change the font color to black. Your bingo card is now ready to print!

Creating Bingo Cards with Formulas

If you don’t want to use tables, you can also create bingo cards with formulas. This method is a bit more time-consuming, but it allows for more flexibility when it comes to formatting your cards.

To get started, open up a new worksheet in Excel and type the following formula into cell A1:
=RANDBETWEEN(1,25)
This will generate a random number between 1 and 25. Now, simply copy and paste the formula into all of the other cells in row 1. This will create your Bingo card matrix.

Next, enter the text that you want on each of your Bingo cards into column B. You can format the text however you like by using different fonts, colors, and sizes. When you are done formatting your text, select all of column B and change the font color to black. Your Bingo card is now ready to print!

#  The Fastest Way to Create Bingo Cards in Excel 

Creating bingo cards in Excel does not have to be a time-consuming process. With the right tools and a bit of know-how, you can have a batch of cards ready in no time. In this article, we will show you the fastest way to create bingo cards in Excel.

The first step is to create a table with the necessary information. The table should have at least 5 columns and 25 rows. The first column should contain the numbers 1 through 25, while the remaining columns should contain the corresponding letters of the alphabet (A through Z).

Once the table is created, you can use a simple VBA macro to create the bingo cards. The VBA code is as follows:

Sub CreateBingoCards()
Dim i As Integer, j As Integer
Sheet1.Range("A1:A25").Copy
Sheet2.Range("A1").PasteSpecial 
Range("A1").Select 
With ActiveSheet 
For i = 1 To .Rows.Count 
For j = 1 To .Columns.Count 
If .Cells(i, j) = Sheet1.Range("A" & i).Value Then 
ActiveCell.Offset(j - 1, 0).Resize(5, 5).FillDown 
End If 
Next j 
Next i 
End With 
End Sub



After running the macro, you will have a sheet with five evenly spaced rows and five columns of randomly generated bingo cards. You can then print out this sheet and start playing!
