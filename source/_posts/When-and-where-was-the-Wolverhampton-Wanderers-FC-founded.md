#  When and where was the Wolverhampton Wanderers FC founded?

The Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club was founded on December 4, 1877. It is a professional football club based in Wolverhampton, England.

#  How many championships has this team won?

The answer to this question isn't as easily found as you would think. Sure, any Red Sox fan could tell you that the team has won eight championships, but how many of those were in the modern era?

It turns out that the Red Sox have only won four championships since 1901, when baseball became a professional sport. The Boston Americans (now the Red Sox) won their first championship in 1903, and then again in 1912. The next championship wasn't until 2004, when the Red Sox swept the Cardinals in four games. They would win again two years later in 2007.

This year's championship was their fourth in the modern era, and ninth overall. It's safe to say that Red Sox fans are hungry for more championships!

#  Who are their biggest rivals?

The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers is one of the most storied in all of sports. The two teams have met in the NBA Finals 12 times, with the Celtics winning nine of those matchups.

Both teams have a rich history, with 29 former players inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Some of the biggest stars in NBA history have played for these two teams, including Larry Bird and Magic Johnson for the Celtics and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal for the Lakers.

The rivalry has been especially intense in recent years, with both teams meeting in the Finals three times between 2008 and 2010. The Celtics won all three matchups, with Bryant and O'Neal being unable to get past Boston's "Big Three" of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen.

While the rivalry is most intense between the Celtics and Lakers, there are other teams that they consider to be their biggest rivals. For the Lakers, that team is the Ginobili-led San Antonio Spurs. The two teams have met in the playoffs six times since 1999, with San Antonio winning four of those matchups.

For the Celtics, their biggest rivals are currently the Philadelphia 76ers. The Celtics have a 17-11 record against Philadelphia over the last ten seasons, but they lost to them in last year's Eastern Conference Semifinals.
