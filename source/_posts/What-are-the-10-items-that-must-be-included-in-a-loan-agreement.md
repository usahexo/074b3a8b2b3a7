#  What are the 10 items that must be included in a loan agreement?

There are many items that may be included in a loan agreement. However, there are certain items that are always required in order for the agreement to be valid and binding. The following is a list of the 10 items that must be included in a loan agreement:

1. The name and contact information of the borrower and lender
2. The amount of the loan
3. The interest rate on the loan
4. The repayment schedule, including when and how the payments will be made
5. Whether the loan is secured or unsecured
6. The maturity date of the loan
7. What will happen if the loan is not repaid by the maturity date
8. Late payment fees and penalties
9. Any special conditions or restrictions on the use of the funds borrowed
10. The signatures of both the borrower and lender

#  Why are they important?

Markdown is a formatting syntax for authoring web pages and articles. It is popular because it is easy to use, and can be read and written in a text editor, without the need for any special software.

It was created by John Gruber in 2004, as a lightweight alternative to HTML for authoring notes and articles. Markdown is now used by many websites and online services, including GitHub, WordPress, and Stack Overflow.

# How does it work?

Markdown works by transforming plain text into HTML, using simple formatting rules. For example, to create a heading:

# My heading

This will create an HTML heading with the text "My heading".Similarly, to create a paragraph:

This is my paragraph.

will create an HTML paragraph with the text "This is my paragraph." The following table lists some of the most common Markdown features:

Feature Syntax Example Heading ## My heading Paragraphs blank line between paragraphs This is my paragraph. Italics *italics* italics Bold **bold** bold Emphasis ~~strikethrough~~ strikethrough Links [my link](http://example.com/) my link Images ![alt text](src/image.jpg) alt text

#  What could happen if one of the items is left out?

When assembling a IKEA dresser, it's important to follow the assembly instructions to ensure that everything goes together correctly. One wrong step and the entire dresser could come crashing down.

What could happen if one of the items is left out?

Assembly of IKEA furniture is often challenging, and requires many steps to be followed in the correct order. One item that is commonly left out or forgotten during assembly is the metal cam lock. This small piece locks the drawer fronts in place and is essential to the stability of the dresser. If this part is not used or installed incorrectly, the dresser could become unstable and dangerous.

In February 2016, a two-year-old boy died after a dresser from IKEA fell on him. The family had assembled the dresser without using the metal cam locks, which caused it to fall over onto the child. This tragic accident could have been prevented if the cam locks were used as instructed.

Since this accident, IKEA has added warnings about not assembling furniture without using all parts to their assembly instructions. They have also created a campaign called #SecureIt which focuses on safely securing furniture in your home.

It's important to follow all assembly instructions when putting together IKEA furniture, and to never skip any steps. If you are unsure about how to properly put something together, ask a friend or family member for help. By doing this, you can avoid potentially deadly accidents like the one that occurred in February 2016.

#  How can a borrower make sure that they are getting a complete loan agreement?

It is important for a borrower to ensure that they are getting a complete loan agreement. This includes all terms and conditions of the loan, as well as any accompanying documents.

The borrower should read through the agreement carefully, and ask questions if there are any areas that are not clear. They should also make sure that they understand the interest rate, repayment schedule, and any other associated costs.

If there are any changes to the original agreement, the borrower should get written confirmation from the lender before proceeding. This helps to avoid any misunderstandings or surprises down the road.

By taking these steps, borrowers can be confident that they are fully protected under the law and have a clear understanding of their loan obligations.

#  What should they do if there is something in the agreement that they don't understand?

If you don't understand something in your lease agreement, ask for clarification from your landlord or property manager. You don't want to be caught off-guard by a hidden clause or fee down the road. If you still don't understand after asking questions, consult with an attorney to ensure you are protecting your interests.
