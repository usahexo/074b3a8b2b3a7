#  State rakes in over $1 billion in gambling taxes from internet casinos 

According to a recent report from the Nevada State Treasurer, the state has raked in more than $1 billion in gambling taxes from internet casinos over the past two years. 

The figure is based on taxes collected from licensed operators of online poker and casino games, as well as sports betting sites that accept players from Nevada. The money was paid to the state by companies located both inside and outside of Nevada. 

While there’s no breakdown of how much tax revenue was generated specifically from internet poker and casino games, it’s clear that their popularity is driving up overall gambling tax receipts. In fiscal year 2017-2018, taxes on casino table games were up 5% over the year before, while those on poker were up 14%. 

This is good news for a state that’s been hit hard by the collapse of the traditional gaming industry. Casinos across Nevada have closed in recent years, putting thousands out of work. The growth in internet gambling has helped to offset some of these losses. 

Nevada isn’t the only state that’s benefiting from online gambling. In fact, it lags behind Pennsylvania and New Jersey, both of which have taken in more than $2 billion in tax revenue since legalizing internet poker and casino games in 2013 and 2014, respectively. 

Nevertheless, the trend is clearly moving in the direction of online gambling, with more states expected to legalize it in the near future. This is likely to create even more opportunities for tax revenue generation – not just for Nevada, but for all states that participate in this growing market.

#  Nevada leads the nation in gambling tax revenue from internet casinos 

Nevada brought in more than $32 million in gambling taxes from internet casinos in the fiscal year 2018, more than any other state in the US. The state’s success is due in part to its expansive regulations for internet gambling, which have made it a hub for the industry.

Gambling taxes are generated by imposing a tax on casino gaming revenue. In Nevada, this tax rate is 6.75%, making it one of the highest in the country. Gambling taxes are an important source of revenue for states, and they are projected to continue growing in popularity as online gambling becomes more widespread.

The rise of internet gambling has led to a growing debate over the role of states in regulating the industry. Some opponents of online gambling argue that it should be regulated at the federal level, while others maintain that states should have primary jurisdiction over the industry.

Online gambling is currently legal in thirteen states, and several other states are considering legislation to legalize it. Nevada has been at the forefront of this movement and has been a leader in developing regulations for internet casinos.

The success of Nevada’s internet gambling industry shows that there is demand for regulated online gaming and that it can be a valuable source of revenue for states.
