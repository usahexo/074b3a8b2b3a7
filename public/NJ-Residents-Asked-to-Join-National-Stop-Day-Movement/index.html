<p>Dubbed “National Stop Day,” the event will call for a stop to all forms of gun-related deaths, including mass shootings, suicides, and unintentional shootings. The movement is being organized by the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America in collaboration with Everytown for Gun Safety.</p>
<p>According to a press release issued by Moms Demand Action, the goal of National Stop Day is “to create a powerful visual statement that demonstrates the breadth and depth of concern across the country about gun violence and its impact on our safety and well-being.”</p>
<p>The group is urging residents to wear orange, post photos of themselves online using the hashtag #NationalStopDay, and demand that their legislators take action to prevent future gun violence.</p>
<p>“We must do more than mourn after each mass shooting – we must take concrete steps to fix our nation’s broken gun laws,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. “This Wednesday, we’re asking people from every state in the country to join us in demanding change from their elected officials. It’s time for Congress to act.”</p>
<p>In addition to legislation that would strengthen background checks and ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, Moms Demand Action is also calling for greater funding for mental health services and programs that help keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s demonstrations will coincide with the National Day of Mourning established by President Barack Obama following the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. That tragedy led to the deaths of 20 children and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Joins-National-Stop-Day-to-Help-End-Gun-Violence"><a href="#NJ-Joins-National-Stop-Day-to-Help-End-Gun-Violence" class="headerlink" title="NJ Joins National Stop Day to Help End Gun Violence"></a>NJ Joins National Stop Day to Help End Gun Violence</h1><p>In light of the many recent mass shootings throughout the country, New Jersey has decided to join the National Stop Day movement in an effort to help end gun violence. This event, which will take place on Friday, December 14th, asks people from all walks of life to pledge not to use or own a gun for one day.</p>
<p>This grassroots campaign was created by two mothers who lost their children to gun violence. The goal is to raise awareness about the dangers of firearms and show that guns are not necessary for everyday life. In addition, participants are encouraged to talk about the issue with their friends and families, as well as lobby their local representatives to push for stricter gun laws.</p>
<p>So far, dozens of states have joined the National Stop Day movement, including California, New York, and Illinois. And while it’s still too early to tell if this will lead to long-term change, it’s important that we continue to fight for our safety and demand action from our lawmakers.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Joins-Nationwide-Effort-to-End-Gun-Violence-on-November-19th"><a href="#New-Jersey-Joins-Nationwide-Effort-to-End-Gun-Violence-on-November-19th" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Joins Nationwide Effort to End Gun Violence on November 19th"></a>New Jersey Joins Nationwide Effort to End Gun Violence on November 19th</h1><p>On Monday, November 19th, New Jersey officials announced that the state would be joining a nationwide effort to end gun violence. Spearheaded by governors in states such as Illinois and Colorado, the campaign will promote legislation and policy changes designed to reduce gun violence.</p>
<p>“This is a pledge we are making to our citizens that we are going to do everything possible to make their lives safer,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy at a press conference on Monday. Murphy was joined by members of the state legislature and law enforcement officials in making the announcement.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of New Jersey’s participation in the campaign is a package of bills designed to reduce gun violence. The proposed legislation includes measures such as universal background checks for all firearm sales, a ban on high-capacity magazines, and a red flag law that would allow authorities to confiscate firearms from individuals deemed dangerous.</p>
<p>The announcement of New Jersey’s participation in the nationwide effort to end gun violence coincides with the start of National Immediate Solutions Week. The week-long campaign, organized by the group Everytown for Gun Safety, aims to promote solutions to gun violence at the local level.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting new legislation, New Jersey officials also announced plans to expand programs that address gun violence prevention. These programs include initiatives designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with mental health issues, and educational campaigns aimed at reducing accidental shootings.</p>
<h1 id="November-19th-A-Day-of-Remembrance-and-Action-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#November-19th-A-Day-of-Remembrance-and-Action-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="November 19th: A Day of Remembrance and Action in New Jersey"></a>November 19th: A Day of Remembrance and Action in New Jersey</h1><p>This year, November 19th marked the third anniversary of the vicious and unprovoked attack on the Muslim community in New Jersey. Three years ago, a group of Islamophobic terrorists drove into a mosque in a quiet residential area during evening prayers, injuring many and causing extensive damage.</p>
<p>This was an act of terrorism, plain and simple. No one could dispute that. But what followed was anything but simple. From the moment news of the attack broke, Muslims in New Jersey – and across the country – were inundated with support from their neighbors, colleagues, and friends. Strangers reached out to offer their help, to condemn the attack, and to stand in solidarity with their Muslim brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>But this solidarity was not enough. The attack on the mosque was only part of a larger trend of hate crimes against Muslims in America. And while it is heartening to see so much support after an attack, we cannot simply rely on acts of solidarity in times of crisis. We need to build relationships of trust and understanding every day, so that when tragedy does strike, we are all there for each other.</p>
<p>That is why on November 19th, we come together not just to remember the victims of the mosque attack, but to take action against hate crimes and Islamophobia. We march together, we rally together, we stand together against bigotry and hatred. Because if we don’t stand up for each other now, then who will?</p>
<h1 id="New-Jerseyans-Urged-to-Take-Part-in-National-Stop-Day"><a href="#New-Jerseyans-Urged-to-Take-Part-in-National-Stop-Day" class="headerlink" title="New Jerseyans Urged to Take Part in National Stop Day"></a>New Jerseyans Urged to Take Part in National Stop Day</h1><p>On Wednesday, September 26, New Jerseyans are being urged to take part in National Stop Day. The goal of the day is to encourage people to think about how they can reduce their waste and make better choices when it comes to sustainability.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways that residents can get involved in National Stop Day. One way is to pledge to stop using single-use plastics. This includes things like plastic straws, cutlery, and shopping bags. Residents can also pledge to recycle more, compost their food waste, and travel less.</p>
<p>In addition to taking the pledge, there are a number of events taking place throughout the state on September 26 that residents can attend to learn more about sustainability and how they can reduce their waste. These events include workshops, film screenings, and plant giveaways.</p>
<p>National Stop Day is a great opportunity for New Jerseyans to come together and work towards making our state more environmentally friendly. By taking the pledge and participating in events throughout the state, we can all work together to create a more sustainable future.</p>
